Setup
-----

1. Install GNU social _directly under a domain_ (Qvitter is not compatible with
subdirectory installs) with _fancy urls_ enabled (if your instance has
"index.php" in its URLs, Qvitter will not work properly) _and HTTPS enabled_ (it's
always best to use HTTPS from the beginning, there will be issues with federation
if you choose to enable HTTPS later)

2. Put all files in local/plugins/Qvitter

3. Add `addPlugin('Qvitter');` to your /config.php file.

4. It's highly recommended to use the StoreRemoteMedia plugin. It will cache attachments from remote instances locally and make them appear in the streams. Add `addPlugin('StoreRemoteMedia');` to your /config.php file. (Only available in newer GNU social)

5. There are settings in QvitterPlugin.php, but for easy updates, put them in config.php instead. Example:

````
// Qvitter-settings
$config['site']['qvitter']['enabledbydefault'] = true;
$config['site']['qvitter']['defaultbackgroundcolor'] = '#f4f4f4';
$config['site']['qvitter']['defaultlinkcolor'] = '#0084B4';
$config['site']['qvitter']['timebetweenpolling'] = 5000;
$config['site']['qvitter']['urlshortenerapiurl'] = 'http://qttr.at/yourls-api.php'; // if your site is on HTTPS, use url to shortener.php here
$config['site']['qvitter']['urlshortenersignature'] = 'b6afeec983';
$config['site']['qvitter']['sitebackground'] = 'img/vagnsmossen.jpg';
$config['site']['qvitter']['favicon_path'] = Plugin::staticPath('Qvitter', '').'img/gnusocial-favicons/';
$config['site']['qvitter']['sprite'] = Plugin::staticPath('Qvitter', '').'img/sprite.png?v=40';
$config['site']['qvitter']['enablewelcometext'] = true;
// $config['site']['qvitter']['customwelcometext']['sv'] = '<h1>Välkommen till Quitter.se – en federerad<sup>1</sup> mikrobloggsallmänning!</h1><p>Etc etc...</p>';
// $config['site']['qvitter']['customwelcometext']['en'] = '<h1>Welcome to Quitter.se – a federated microblog common!</h1><p>Etc etc...</p>';
// $config['site']['qvitter']['customtermsofuse'] = 'Our custom terms of use';
$config['site']['qvitter']['blocked_ips'] = array();

// Recommended GNU social settings
$config['thumbnail']['maxsize'] = 3000; // recommended setting to get more high-res image previews
$config['profile']['delete'] = true; // twitter users are used to being able to remove their accounts
$config['profile']['changenick'] = true; // twitter users are used to being able to change their nicknames
$config['public']['localonly'] = true; // only local users in the public timeline (qvitter always has a timeline for the whole known network)
addPlugin('StoreRemoteMedia'); // makes remote images appear in the feed

````

The settings should be self-explanatory. In doubt, ask in the !qvitter group on quitter.se, or email h@nnesmannerhe.im

6. For better performance, disable checkschema (instructions in GNU social's config.php),
but don't forget to run it when updating plugins (including Qvitter).

7. To change the logo, edit /img/sprite.png. For easier git-updates, put it in GNU social's locale folder, and edit the sprite path setting above.


Translation
-----

1. Translation files reside in /locale and /doc folders.

2. When translating .json files, don't translate the placeholder strings inside curly brackets {}

API
-----

Qvitter uses GNU social's built in "twitter compatible" API. The API was designed to be
compatible with Twitter's API v1.0. Some documentation is here: <http://skilledtests.com/wiki/Twitter-compatible_API>
Twitter's API v1.1 documentation is also useful, but may be partly incorrect.

Qvitter extends this API in a few undocumented ways. See onRouterInitialized() in QvitterPlugin.php
for ideas about paths for the API extensions.


Notes
-----

Qvitter is tested with the latest GNU social nightly
