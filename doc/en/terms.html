<p>{instance-name} is not a service and you are not a customer here. We are a small part of
a bigger social change, creating a large decentralized community. This means that we don't
have to be neutral toward the content on our GNU social instance. If you don't like the
direction this instance is going, you are free to move to another instance or start your own.
You will still be able to follow and be followed (and blocked) by users on this instance.</p>

<p>In constrast to the top-down authority of commercial social media, this creates a kind
of flat power structure. We are enabled to protect eachother from harassment and oppression,
but without centralized censorship.</p>

<p>On this instance, users who harass others will be removed. We also take a strong stance
against e.g. racism, sexism, ableism, antisemitism, homo- and transphobia. Such expressions make the
site unsafe for other users, and in practice limit their freedom of speech.</p>

<p>The Public Timeline is considered an especially sensitive place. It is what new users see,
and all registered users will see the posts published there. Moderators can exclude users
from appearing in the public timeline it at any moment, without warning, permanently or
temporarily. Consider it a privilege to be published in the public timeline, not a right.
If you are excluded from the public timeline, you can still use all other features on the
site just like any other user.</p>

<p>Advertising and commercial entities are not allowed on this instance. We are completely
non-profit and all our expenses are payed for by donations from individuals.

<p>Each user is responsible for the content they submit. If you have any questions
about something posted on this instance, contact the user in question first. As a last resort you
can email the <a href="mailto:{instance-email}">admins</a>.</p>
